# OrbitalRX Coding Challenge

Welcome! This challenge should take you about an hour. 

We installed a couple packages to get you started, so you should have to run `npm i` to install everything before getting started. For instructions on how to start your react server locally, see the `Create React App` docs below.

- For the challenge, check out `App.tsx`. At the top of the file are a few `TO DO`s. Our hope is for you to get through the first two, or at least one of them and a dent in the other, in an hour. If you have time, check out the `BONUS` etc TO DO's. 
- Feel free to install any packages you like to complete the challenge. If you do, please just let us know below what they were and give us a quick insight--a sentence or two--into why you chose them. 
- Include any other feedback you might have here in the README--if it took you longer than expected, if something wasn't clear.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
